# AWS Foundations

## Overview of AWS

### Cloud Computing Models
- IaaS vs Paas#
AWS offers both

#### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):
- allows organizations to utilize AWS instead of owning and operating their own datacenter. You can simply rent VMs or physical servers from AWS
- Amazon Web Services manages the Infrastructure for you. They own and operate the data center and give the user VMs and other services at a fractional cost to the user.

#### The Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying platforms like a database, streaming services, etc. 
- allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your core applications and not worry about the IaaS and PaaS layers
- ets organizations to be more efficient and focused as you donâ€™t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.
