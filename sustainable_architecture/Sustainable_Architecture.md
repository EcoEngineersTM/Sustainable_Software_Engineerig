# Techincal Debt
- Test debt
- design and architecture debt
- implementation debt

Architecture Improvement
- lower maintenance cost

Architectural Erosion:
- need to refactoring 

# Refactoring is Key

# Architechture and Cognitive Psychology
Approximately 70% of our time is spent reading and understanding existing source code. 20% is spent in solving the problem. And just 10% of our time, we actually write new code.

    ## Components of Structure-Building Process
    - Chunking: group to memorize 
      - modularity: well-structured architecture
    - Hierachies: human memory 
      - layering
    - Schemata

# LAayering an Architecture

## Techincal Layering
- presentiation
- Application layer
- Domain Layer
- Infrastructure layers

## Main LAyering

2D in the Source Code


# Modularity
- High Cohesion + loose Coupling
- Sepration of concerns
-
